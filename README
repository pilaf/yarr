YARR - Yet Another Rails Ripoff
===============================

YARR (pronounced in a piratey voice) is an attempt to make PHP slightly less painful for a Rails zealot (sadly, you don't always get a choice).

Still *heavily* incomplete and experimental and with no documentation whatsoever, I do not recommend anyone to use this for anything serious.

WARNING: It may contain coding styles that could be considered offensive by long-time PHP coders.

Features
========

- ActiveRecord implementation with associations (not yet finished)

TODO List
=========

- Rewrite controllers and router
- REST routes
- Generators
- PHP-based HTTP server (for Rails-like 'script/server' with interactive debugging)
- Plugins
- ActiveRecord validations
- Tests
- Documentation

Requirements
============

PHP >=5.1
